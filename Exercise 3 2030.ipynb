    "__Buffon's needle__ is a classic problem in Monte Carlo sampling, originally posed by the 18th century naturalist and mathematician George-Louis Leclerc. The problem is as follows:\n",
    "> Suppose you drop needles of length $\\ell$ at random onto a floor that has a series of equidistant parallel lines, with separation distance $d$. Provided $\\ell \\le d$, the probability that a needle will cross a line on the floor is\n",
    "$$p = \\frac{2\\ell}{\\pi d} \\, . \\qquad {\\rm (1)} $$\n",

    "We will *not* prove this result analytically. (Proofs can be found online for the curious reader.) \n",
    "Rearranging Eq. (1), we have \n",
    "$$\\pi = \\frac{2\\ell}{p d} \\, . \\qquad {\\rm (2)} $$\n",
    "Our goal is to perform a Monte Carlo simulation where we drop $N$ needles on a suitably-lined floor, estimate the probability $p$, and thereby provide a numerical estimate for $\\pi$ according to Eq. (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "For each neeedle drop, we have two discrete choices, labeled by $x$: \n",
    "- The needle crosses a line, labeled as $x=1$, occuring with probability $p$.\n",
    "- The needle does not cross a line, labeled as $x=0$, occuring with probability $1-p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We write it in this way to make it clear that we are dealing with the same Bernoulli distribution we had for flipping a coin. Although we don't know $p$ *a priori*, we recall that $\\langle x \\rangle$ approaches the true mean $\\mu = p$ for large $N$, according to the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we simply count the number of needles that cross a line, $N_{\\rm cross}$. Then $\\langle x \\rangle = N_{\\rm cross}/N$ is our estimate for $p$, which allows us to estimate $\\pi$.\n"
